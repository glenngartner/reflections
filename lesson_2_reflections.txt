What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new project space, or directory, is initialized as a git version controlled repository. Meta data is created, particularly a .Git folder, containing information about the repo (history, file names, etc). 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area can hold any files selected by the "add" command. It can be less than the number of files in the working directory, but not more. The repository contains the files that are committed after an add, not necessarily all the files in the working directory. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can do a diff on the file in your working directory, and the file in the stage, before you commit. In reviewing the changes, you can confirm its one logical change.
